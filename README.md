# Crypto Prediction Model

## Overview
The **Crypto Prediction Model** is a deep learning-based system that utilizes **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** to predict cryptocurrency price trends. The model analyzes historical price data to forecast future values, assisting traders and investors in decision-making.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-based Forecasting**: Uses LSTM for time-series prediction.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Predicts cryptocurrency price movements based on past data.
- **Trend Visualization**: Displays price trends using graphical representations.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Built using Flask for easy interaction.
- **Scalable**: Can be trained on various cryptocurrencies for broader application.

## Dataset
The model is trained using cryptocurrency market data, including features such as:
- **Open Price**
- **Close Price**
- **High & Low Prices**
- **Trading Volume**
- **Market Capitalization**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **Flask** (for web-based UI)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for data preprocessing)

## Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of:
1. **LSTM Layers**: Captures sequential patterns in cryptocurrency prices.
2. **Dense Layers**: Processes extracted features for final predictions.
3. **Activation Functions**: ReLU for hidden layers, Linear for output.
4. **Optimization Algorithm**: Adam optimizer for efficient training.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Flask
- Pandas
- NumPy
